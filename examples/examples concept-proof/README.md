## easy_cross.lp
This file contains the easiest vertex conflict imaginable with two robots.

![easy_cross.lp](../../images/easy_cross.png)

## double_cross.lp
Tests, whether two consecutive vertex conflicts can be solved - no dodging possible.

![double_cross.lp](../../images/double_cross.png)

## three_robots.lp
This file tests the programs behaviour if there are two collisions with a total of three robots.

![three_robots.lp](../../images/three_robots.png)

## timingConflict.lp
In this case a vertex conflict cannot be avoided simply by waiting - it is necessary to look at past moves.

![timingConflict.lp](../../images/timingConflict.png)

## easy_edgeConflict.lp
This file contains plans for a very simple edge conflict.

![easy_edgeConflict.lp](../../images/easy_edgeConflict.png)

## wide_and_simple.lp
This file is a vertex-confict with much space to see how it will be solved in an open eviroment.

![wide_and_simple.lp](../../images/wide_and_simple.png)

## bottleneck.lp
This file contains a small passage and three robot who want to cross it in different directions. Multiple vertex- and edge-conflicts have to be solved.

![bottleneck.lp](../../images/bottleneck.png)

## easy_unsat.lp
Very small example with no possible solution.
