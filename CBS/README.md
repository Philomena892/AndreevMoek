### node.py
This file contains the high level search of our CBS implementation.
```
usage: node.py [-h] [-b] [-g] input [benchmark_file]

positional arguments:
  input            ASP file containing robot plans
  benchmark_file   By default benchmarked values are saved in bm_output.csv. Specify a file here,
                   if you want to append them to it instead.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help       show this help message and exit
  -b, --benchmark  output benchmarked values to the command line
  -g, --greedy     enable when you want to use a faster but suboptimal greedy search

```
For more details, look at the top folder.

### lowlevel.lp
Contains the low-level search to CBS written in ASP.

### lowlevel_greedy.lp
Contains the low-level search to the greedy version of CBS. This minimizes the number of conflicts.

### make_examples.py
Run this file to generate multiple examples of different sizes and robot-densities. The problem files are created using the asprilo generator and are random. 

### first_iteration.lp
To use the examples generated by `make_examples.py` you first have to add minimal paths for each robot to its goal. That is what `first_iteration.lp` does.

### benchmark.py
Run this to benchmark all files created by `make_examples.py`. The results will be saved in `benchmark_results.csv`.
