# example instances

## big_problem.lp
16 robots try to cross a crossroad at the same time. This is not the setup for a joke, but a very serious problem. Hard to solve, so expect a long runtime.

## warehouse problems
The following examples try to simulate more realistic warehouse-scenarios. There are three categories:

### warehouse1_X.lp
Robots come from two sides (not too close to each other). There are 3 lines, in which there can be shelfs for the robots. Shelf-lines can be passed.

### warehouse2_X.lp
Robots come from all directions, as far away from each other as possible to simulate random directions. There are 3 lines, in which there can be shelfs for the robots. Shelf-lines can be passed.

### warehouse3_X.lp
Robots come from two sides (not too close to each other). There are 2 lines next to which the shelfs can be positioned. The lines can not be passed. Additional to the side-passages, there is another passage in the middle of the lines.
