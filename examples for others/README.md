# Examples for other groups to benchmark

These are the examples, made for asprillo, for the other groups in our 'KRR Projects' module to benchmark on.

In general node_greedy.py performs significantly better than node.py, but isn't always optimal.

## ex8.lp

A field of size 7x7 and a robot-density of 40%. node.py could solve it in about 30s on our computer, which is relativaly fast for a problem of this scale.

## 14robs.lp

A field of size 7x7 with 14 robots. node.py could solve it in just under 4 minutes, which was close to our limitation.
